User id for the first user (attacker, sender of the message, one of the traders)

Graphml Files
Files with ".graphml" extension have the following features for every network node:
label
in-degree
out-degree

and edges:
label
time (in Linux format)
You can use network analysis packages in order to use these files. Also, most programming languages have packages available for reading graphml files and converting them into Graph and Network data structures.

Community Membership

These are stored in txt files one for each day of the 30days period. Each line of the files contains a list of the uids that belong to the community at that timestep.
Lines with only one uid indicate communities of size one. Structure of communities changes over time.
